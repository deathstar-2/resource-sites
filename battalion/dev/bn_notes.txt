a military unit composed of a headquarters and two or more companies, batteries, or similar units

The Battalion is the smallest organization that is capable of independent operations for more than three days but less than 8 days; the largest organic survivabiliy factor being water, fuel, and in times of armed conflict, ammunition expenditure rates.  Various types of Battalions can exist within a large military organization; Infantry, Artillery, Aviation, Cyber, Reconnaissance, Human Resources.

Operationally, all Battalion units work to support the a main effort; a classic Infantry Battalion or more modern main efforts like civil operations units or cyber defense units.

No matter the unit, a Battalion includes key components that define itself as the first military echelon where independent operation materializes; a feature separating itself from its subordinate, the company.
