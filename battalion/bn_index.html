			<h1>The Battalion</h1>
			<p>The Battalion is the smallest organization that is capable of independent operations for more than three days but less than 8 days; the largest organic survivabiliy factor being water, fuel, and in times of armed conflict, ammunition expenditure rates.  Various types of Battalions can exist within a large military organization; Infantry, Artillery, Aviation, Cyber, Reconnaissance, Human Resources to name a few.

			<br/><br/> Operationally, Battalion units within a defined operational area are missioned to support a main effort.  Main efforts can range from a classic Infantry Battalion to more modern main efforts such as civil operations units or cyber defense units.
			
			<br/><br/>No matter the type of unit, logistics or combat, a Battalion in most modern militaries includes key components that define itself as the first military echelon where independent operations materialize; features separating itself from its subordinate, the company: <br/> <br/> </p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>1. Field Officer Designated Commander</li></br>
			<li>2. Military Staff</li></br>
			<li>3. Independent Operations</li></br>

			<h1>Command Guidance</h1>
			<p>Modern military battalion structures are headed by what is commonly referred to as a command group; a Commander (CDR), the senior-most sergeant (sometimes referred to as the Command Sergeant Major (CSM)), and an Executive Officer (XO) (sometimes referred to as the Chief of Staff (CoS)). 
			
			 <br/> <br/>Command guidance generally encompasses a Commander's vision and glidepath, the senior Non-Commissioned Officer's (Command Sergeant Major) counsel on the conduct and discipline of Soldiers, and the Executive Officer's management of the commander's staff.  These three headstones of the battalion work in tandem as the compass on which the battalion aligns itself; both in training for and during military operations.

			<h1>Organizational Structure</h1>
			<p>A great number of modern military battalions are structured as outlined in what is commonly referred to as a Table of Orgnizational Elements (TOE).  This design structure describes the number of personnel and equipment, as well as their purpose, at each level, each echelon.  These structures evolve; developed and reauthorized continuously at regular intervals over time.
			
			<br/><br/>Schematically, TOE documentation is configured at-echelon as nested tables  that describe the quantity and type of equipment and personnel.   At the battalion level, an organizational structure generally encompasses a headquarters element that includes a command group and the military staff, as well as the subordinate companies and sections that provide both maneuver and maneuver support.</p>

			<h1>Calendar & Battle Rhythm</h1>
			<p>"It's not enough to be busy, so are the ants.  The question is, what are we busy about?" - Henry David Thoreau
			
			 <br/><br/>Battalion operations are in large governed and managed through the use of the most basic time management mechanisms, operational calendars.  These calendars are generally comprised of a Short Range Calendar, Long Range Calendar, and Battle Rhythm.  In conjunction with command guidance, these three calendar systems manage expectations and provide predictability.

			<h1>Battalion Staff & Operations</h1>
			<p>"Staffs synchronize actions, coordinate actions, inform the commander, and provide procedural control to support the commanderâ€™s ability to assess, use judgment, and make decisions." ATP 3-21.20
			
			<br/><br/>"The operations process is a commander-led activity, informed by the mission command approach to planning, preparing, executing, and assessing military operations. These activities may be sequential or simultaneous ... The battalion commander, assisted by the battalion staff, uses the operations process to drive the ... planning necessary to understand, visualize, and describe the operational environment, make and articulate decisions; and direct, lead, and assess military operations." ATP 3-21.20

			<h1>Resilience</h1>
			<p>"Resilience enables leaders and their organizations to endure and ultimately prevail over hardship. Resilience and commitment to accomplish the mission is critical to overcoming adversity. Resilient Soldiers can recover quickly from setbacks, shock, and injuries while maintaining focus on their jobs and the mission. Resilient leaders learn and grow from experiencing difficult situations. Leaders instill resilience and a winning spirit in subordinates through personal example and tough, realistic training." 3-11, ADP 6-22 <br/> </p>

			<h1>Quality Management</h1>
			<p>"Quality is never an accident. It is always the result of intelligent effort." - John Ruskin

			<br/><br/>The quality of a military determines the extent to which it can guarantee the liberties of the people for which it serves.  A quality management system helps  commanders and their organizations at-echelon measure the degree of quality as well as understand the level to which each measured factor is contributing to or detracting from the quality of the organization.  Absent quality management, militaries can increasingly become costly to governments, and increasingly degrade their ability to serve as an effective defense.
