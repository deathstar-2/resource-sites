			<h1>The Company</h1>
			<p>For most modern militaries, the company is the first echelon that is led by a commander, a unit that generally consists of anywhere from 80 to 120 personnel; an organization that can generally sustain itself for a period of no more than 72 hours without external resupply.  A company can also go by terms such as a Troop when the unit is associated with a Cavalry or Reconnaissance element or a Battery when associated with an Artillery element.
			
			<br/><br/>No matter the type of unit, logistics or combat, a Company in most modern militaries includes key components that define itself as the first military echelon where a commander is assigned; features separating itself from its subordinate, the platoon: <br/> <br/> </p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>1. Company Grade or Junior Field Officer Designated Commander</li></br><br/>
			<li>2. 24-72 Hours of Continuous Operations</li></br>
